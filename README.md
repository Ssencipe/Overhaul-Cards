# Version 0.3.2:
- Added Spellslinger to round out minor improvement card set
- Renamed Corpuslinger to Weightslinger to be easier to understand thematically
- Fixed issue with Begone persisting after rematch and set it to not allow duplicates
- Fixed issue with Delay adding more time between bursts per card and changed bullet color to be distinct from Parasite
- Added effect duration added per card to Embiggen and Minimize stat descriptions

---
# Version 0.3.1:
- Fixed flea increasing speed absurdly (sorry tweaked it when testing and forgot to change back)
- Updated outdated Minimize description and added change to README
- Tweaked Gunslinger (Removed extra bullet & 10% spread, Reload & Attack Speed 10% -> 15%, Ammo +1 -> +2)
- Made Embiggen and Minimize descriptions reflect their effects more precisely

---
# Version 0.3.0:
- Added Root Regen and Gravity patches as dependencies
- Added Boxed In
- Removed Shrink and Super Jump
- These cards also fall into a category of uninspired cards that are basic or similar to other mods'
- Disabled Ambush
- Ambush is also similar to cards in other mods, so it is temporarily disabled until I rework it.
- Recoded Minimize and Embigged; they should be more consistent in behavior
- Minimize now reduces damage instead of health to stop it from conflicting with Embiggen

---
# Version 0.2.0:
- Removed Bullet Wall, Porcupine, Wave Form, Eye Beam, and Impact
- These cards were removed due to them not being very unique or interesting in the grand scheme of the ROUNDS modding scene. Some basic cards remain to flesh out the mod, but major gun based cards have been removed unless I feel they provide something new or interesting.
- Added Begone and Corvuslinger
- Buffed Minimize and Embiggen (Block Cooldown +2.5s -> +1s)
- Buffed Delay (Time between bursts 2s -> 1.5s)
- Reworded block cards for brevity
- Adjusted README

---
# Version 0.1.1: 
- Nerfed Ambush (Block Cooldown 2.5s -> 3s, Now reduces attack and move speed temporarily after block)
- Buffed Porcupine (Bullet Speed -65% -> -50%, card is now Rare)
- Buffed Super Jump Buff (Removed Block Cooldown Increase)
- Nerfed Eye Beam (Damage Reduction -96.7% -> -99%, Bullet Life 0.2s -> 0.15s)
- Fixed typo on Shrink

---
# Version 0.1.0:

- Fixed issue with Ambush and Warp effects not being removed on rematch

---
# Version 0.0.3: 
- Reworked icon because yikes
- Cosmetic Bullet Wall Buff (Reload Time +3.5s -> +3s)
- 0.0.2 balance should actually exist now

---
